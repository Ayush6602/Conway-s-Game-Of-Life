You can play the game by running the jar file if JRE is installed in your system but I would recommend clonning the repo and try to edit and play with the code.

## Folder Structure

There is only one pakage in the folder
'blank' - The main pakage with the source files

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
